.SH NAME
tortoize \- Calculate ramachandran z-scores
.SH SYNOPSIS
tortoize [OPTION] input [output]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tortoize validates protein structure models by checking the
Ramachandran plot and side-chain rotamer distributions. Quality
Z-scores are given at the residue level and at the model level
(ramachandran-z and torsions-z). Higher scores are better. To compare
models or to describe the reliability of the model Z-scores jackknife-
based standard deviations are also reported (ramachandran-jackknife-sd
and torsion-jackknife-sd).
.SH OPTIONS
The input file can be either mmCIF or PDB format and the file may be
gzip or bzip2 compressed.
.sp
The output is a json file, if no file name is specified the output is
written to \fIstdout\fR.
.TP
\fB--dict\fR=<file>
Specify a dictionary file containing restraints for residues specific to
this file.
.TP
\fB--log\fR=<file>
Write a log with diagnostic information to this file.
